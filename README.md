# Overview

This notebook tries to predict the time spend on social media through a number of input variables like age, gender, interests or location.
The dataset itself is rather small with only 1000 data points, which makes this prediction problem challening.

# Dataset

Kaggle "Average Time Spent By A User On Social Media" dataset.

The notebook expects the csv file to be in the same folder as all the other files, no additional data folder is needed.
